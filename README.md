# LSTM-Vs-simple-RNN-
LSTMs and RNN are old compared to LLMs, but still! this project by using PyTorch with RNNs, LSTMs, and a custom Seq2Seq model for English-to-French translation. Covers model creation, preprocessing, and training pipeline. Part 1 focuses on basic RNNs; Part 2 builds an end-to-end translation system.
